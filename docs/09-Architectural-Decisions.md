## 9. Design Decisions

The design decisions documented here outline the key choices made during the design and implementation of the secure password exchange application, based on the Building Block View.

### 9.1 Use of AWS Serverless Architecture

**Decision**: Adopt AWS serverless services for the core application components.

**Reason**: Serverless architecture offers automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, and cost efficiency by aligning costs with actual usage.

**Implications**:
- No need to manage server infrastructure.
- Potential cold start latency for AWS Lambda functions.
- Pay-per-use pricing model.

### 9.2 Isolated Network Environment

**Decision**: Deploy the application within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

**Reason**: Ensures the application is only accessible within the customer’s private network, enhancing security.

**Implications**:
- Additional configuration required for VPC, subnets, and security groups.
- Control over network traffic and resource access within the VPC.

### 9.3 User Authentication and Authorization

**Decision**: Use Amazon Cognito for managing user authentication and AWS IAM for access control.

**Reason**: Provides secure and scalable authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Implications**:
- Simplified user management and authentication flows.
- Fine-grained access control using IAM policies.

### 9.4 Data Encryption

**Decision**: Implement data encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and HTTPS.

**Reason**: Protect sensitive password data from unauthorized access.

**Implications**:
- Increased security for stored and transmitted data.
- Additional configuration for managing encryption keys with AWS KMS.

### 9.5 Event-Driven Processing

**Decision**: Use AWS EventBridge for managing event-driven workflows.

**Reason**: Automates actions based on specific events, such as password expiration.

**Implications**:
- Simplified event handling and integration with other AWS services.
- Potential complexity in managing event rules and targets.

### 9.6 Monitoring and Logging

**Decision**: Utilize Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging application activities.

**Reason**: Provides visibility into system operations, aids in troubleshooting, and ensures compliance.

**Implications**:
- Centralized logging and monitoring.
- Potential additional costs for storing and analyzing logs.

### 9.7 Database Choice

**Decision**: Use Amazon DynamoDB as the NoSQL database for storing encrypted passwords.

**Reason**: DynamoDB offers high availability, scalability, and low latency for handling large amounts of data.

**Implications**:
- NoSQL data model and query limitations.
- Cost considerations based on read/write capacity units and storage.

### 9.8 Static Web Hosting

**Decision**: Host the web interface on Amazon S3 with static website hosting.

**Reason**: S3 provides a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution for hosting static web content.

**Implications**:
- No need for server management for hosting web content.
- Simplified deployment and scaling of web interface.

### 9.9 API Management

**Decision**: Use Amazon API Gateway to manage API requests to the backend services.

**Reason**: Provides a secure and scalable solution for exposing API endpoints and managing API traffic.

**Implications**:
- Simplified API management and security.
- Potential cost based on the number of API calls.

### 9.10 IAM Roles and Policies

**Decision**: Implement fine-grained access control using AWS IAM roles and policies.

**Reason**: Ensures secure access to AWS resources, following the principle of least privilege.

**Implications**:
- Requires careful planning and management of IAM policies.
- Enhanced security through controlled access permissions.

### Conclusion

The design decisions outlined above provide a comprehensive overview of the key choices made during the design and implementation of the secure password exchange application. These decisions ensure that the solution is secure, scalable, and maintainable, meeting the customer’s requirements effectively.
