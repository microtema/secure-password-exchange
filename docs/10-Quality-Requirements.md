## 10. Quality Requirements

The quality requirements section outlines the key quality attributes that the secure password exchange application must fulfill. 
These requirements ensure that the system meets the necessary standards for performance, security, usability, and maintainability.

### 10.1 Quality Tree

**Security**
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Use Amazon Cognito for managing user authentication and AWS IAM for access control to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.
- **Data Encryption**: Implement data encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and HTTPS to protect sensitive password data from unauthorized access.
- **Network Security**: Deploy the application within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure it is only accessible within the customerâ€™s private network.

**Performance**
- **Scalability**: Use AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB to automatically scale based on demand, ensuring the application can handle varying loads efficiently.
- **Latency**: Optimize API Gateway and Lambda functions to minimize latency and provide a responsive user experience.

**Usability**
- **User Interface**: Host the web interface on Amazon S3 for reliable and scalable static website hosting, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive interface.
- **Accessibility**: Follow best practices for web accessibility to ensure the application is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.

**Maintainability**
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Utilize Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging application activities to provide visibility into system operations and aid in troubleshooting.
- **Deployment Automation**: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to automate the deployment and management of AWS resources, ensuring consistent and reliable releases.

### 10.2 Quality Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Secure Password Storage**
- **Quality Attribute**: Security
- **Description**: When a user stores a password, the system encrypts the password using AWS KMS and stores it in Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Measurement**: All passwords must be encrypted before storage, and encryption keys must be managed securely.

**Scenario 2: High Availability**
- **Quality Attribute**: Performance
- **Description**: The system must handle a large number of concurrent users storing and retrieving passwords without performance degradation.
- **Measurement**: The system should scale automatically to handle at least 10,000 concurrent users with response times under 1 second.

**Scenario 3: User Authentication**
- **Quality Attribute**: Security
- **Description**: Users must authenticate using Amazon Cognito before accessing the system to store or retrieve passwords.
- **Measurement**: 100% of access requests must be authenticated and authorized.

**Scenario 4: Error Handling and Logging**
- **Quality Attribute**: Maintainability
- **Description**: The system must log all errors and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- **Measurement**: 100% of errors are logged in CloudWatch, and user-facing error messages should be clear and actionable.

**Scenario 5: Usability of the Web Interface**
- **Quality Attribute**: Usability
- **Description**: The web interface must be responsive and easy to use for storing and retrieving passwords.
- **Measurement**: User satisfaction ratings should average 4 out of 5 or higher in usability tests.

**Scenario 6: Compliance with Data Protection Regulations**
- **Quality Attribute**: Security, Compliance
- **Description**: The system must comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR.
- **Measurement**: Regular audits must show 100% compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
