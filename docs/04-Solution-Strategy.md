## 4. Solution Strategy

### 4.1 Overall Solution Approach

The overall solution leverages AWS serverless architecture to create a secure, scalable, and maintainable application for password exchange among employees. 
The architecture is designed to ensure high security, ease of use, and efficient management of passwords, integrating several AWS services to achieve these goals.

### 4.2 Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Use of Serverless Architecture**:
    - **Reason**: Serverless architecture allows automatic scaling, reduces operational overhead, and aligns costs with actual usage.
    - **Components**: AWS Lambda for processing, Amazon API Gateway for managing API requests, and Amazon S3 for static content hosting.

2. **Isolated Network Environment**:
    - **Reason**: Ensures that the application is only accessible within the customer's private network, enhancing security.
    - **Components**: AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate the network and control access.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - **Reason**: Secure user access and authorization are critical for sensitive operations like password management.
    - **Components**: Amazon Cognito for user authentication and AWS IAM for access control.

4. **Data Encryption**:
    - **Reason**: Protect sensitive password data both at rest and in transit.
    - **Components**: AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption keys, and HTTPS for secure data transmission.

5. **Event-Driven Processing**:
    - **Reason**: Automates actions based on specific events, such as password expiration.
    - **Components**: AWS EventBridge to manage event-driven workflows and triggers.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - **Reason**: Provides visibility into system operations, helps in troubleshooting, and ensures compliance.
    - **Components**: Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.

### 4.3 Key Solution Elements

**User Interface**:
- **Amazon S3**: Hosts static web content for the application interface.
- **Route S3**: Manages routing to the static content.

**API Management**:
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages all API requests, ensuring secure and efficient communication between the user and backend services.
- **API Key and IAM Policy**: Ensure secure access to the APIs, limiting usage to authorized users.

**Password Management**:
- **AWS Lambda Functions**:
    - **Store Password**: Encrypts and stores passwords in the NoSQL database.
    - **Read Password**: Decrypts and retrieves passwords from the NoSQL database.
    - **Delete Password**: Removes expired passwords from the NoSQL database.

**Database**:
- **NoSQL Database**: Securely stores encrypted password entries, ensuring data integrity and availability.

**Event Handling**:
- **AWS EventBridge**:
    - Manages password lifecycle events such as storage, retrieval, and expiration.
    - Automates workflows based on event triggers to handle password expiration and deletion.

**Security and Access Control**:
- **Amazon Cognito**: Manages user authentication, providing secure access tokens for API usage.
- **AWS IAM Roles**: Define permissions and roles for accessing different AWS resources securely.

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Collects and analyzes logs, monitors system performance, and triggers alerts for any issues.

### Implementation Details

1. **User Access**:
    - Users interact with the application via a web interface hosted on Amazon S3.
    - Actions such as storing, retrieving, and deleting passwords are initiated through API requests managed by Amazon API Gateway.

2. **Processing Logic**:
    - API Gateway routes requests to AWS Lambda functions.
    - Lambda functions handle the core logic for encrypting, decrypting, and storing passwords in the NoSQL database.

3. **Data Security**:
    - Passwords are encrypted using AWS KMS before storage.
    - Encrypted passwords are stored in the NoSQL database, ensuring they remain secure at rest.

4. **Event Management**:
    - AWS EventBridge listens for specific events (e.g., password stored, read, expired) and triggers appropriate actions.
    - Events such as password expiration are scheduled and handled automatically.

5. **Monitoring and Compliance**:
    - All actions and events are logged in Amazon CloudWatch.
    - CloudWatch provides monitoring dashboards and sets up alerts to notify administrators of any anomalies.
