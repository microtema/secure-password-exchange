### AWS Serverless Architecture

**Date:** 2024-07-11

#### Status

Accepted

#### Context

The application needs to be scalable, cost-efficient, and minimize operational overhead. Serverless architecture is known for its automatic scaling and pay-per-use model, which aligns with these requirements.

#### Decision

Adopt AWS serverless services, including AWS Lambda for processing, Amazon API Gateway for managing API requests, and Amazon S3 for static content hosting.

#### Consequences

- **Positive:** Automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, cost efficiency.
- **Negative:** Potential cold start latency for AWS Lambda functions, dependency on AWS services.
